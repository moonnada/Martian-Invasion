# Martian-Invasion
The Air Force has been compiling a database of Martian space-travelers in residence at Roswell, New Mexico. It's a simple data-base composed of last name, first name, and MSSN (martian social security number). Unfortunately, searching the database is difficult because it is not sorted in any way. Your task is to provide three sorted lists of Martians, one by first name, one by last name, and one by MSSN.
